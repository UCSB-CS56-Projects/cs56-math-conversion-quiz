# Lab03 First Look at Legacy Code 

### (a) (20 pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I’m looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.

The cs56 Math Conversion Quiz program contains both a command-line and GUI version that allows users to practice number conversions between binary (including masking), decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. The program accomplishes this task by prompting the user to enter the number of questions they would like to practice as well as their preferred numeral system, and then starts a quiz based on the user’s responses.  

### (b) (20 pts) a set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.
	
As a student studying for my CS 64 midterm, I can practice my conversions from different bases so that I can do well on the test. As a teacher, I can give my math students quizzes so that I do not have to write the quizzes by hand. 

### (c) (20 pts) a brief assessment of whether the software runs or not. If it runs, briefly describe what it does,

The software in its current state can run both the command-line and GUI versions. The command-line version asks for a number of questions, prompts the user to select a numeral system to be quizzed on, and then starts the quiz.  One cannot change the numeral system on the command-line version once the quiz has started. The GUI version first opens a new window that asks the user to select a difficulty level, prompts the user for a number of questions in a new window, then starts the quiz in a new window. Unlike the command-line version, once the quiz has started in the GUI version, the user can change the numeral system to practice at any time and get hints on each question. A difficulty level is not prompted for in the command-line version. At the end of the quiz on both versions, the program tells the user their score.  

### (d) (20 pts) a set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.

As a student using the program to study for his class,it would be convenient if you could switch the difficulty and the number of questions without having to reopen the program. As the same student, it would be extremely useful if I could keep track of my overall progress and see how I am approving and what I need to approve on. As the same student, it would feel more rewarding and fun if doing well on the quiz resulted in some sort of sound effect or animation.

### (e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?

The current README.md is clear and concise and really helps the developers get familiar with the project before having looked at the actual code. It also tells developers where to find the source code, what each class does, as well as how the objects of each class depend on one another. One idea to improve the README.md would be to include a basic workflow through screenshots and basic descriptions of each step. This would be useful as we had to actually run both the command-line and the GUI individually a couple of times to discover what features were specific to each version.  

### (f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file. Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).

All of the targets have descriptions. The older version of the javadoc target is commentated out and should be removed. Besides, the current state of the build.xml is ample and does not need immediate adjustment. 

### (g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current “issues”. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?

Currently, there are nine open issues that can be worked on. All of the expectations for these issues are clear and explicitly state where/when they occur. These issues all offer a better functionality and aesthetics for the quiz through added features and a bug fix. After calculating the points from all the issues, we determined that we would not be able to accumulate 1000 points even if we fixed all nine issues. The point value for fixing all the issues would be 575 leaving us with a deficit of 425 points.  

### (h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.

### (i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?

The code in each of the source files is organized well and make it easy for the developer to read and understand what each line is doing. All of the methods are implemented to do their function without becoming too large and cluttered. Each method is labeled with a description of the function it is meant to carry out as well as with short, descriptive comments meant to explain the purpose of the action being performed. The README.md did a good job of outlining what each of the major classes are as well as what their purpose is. The main classes are Quiz.java, Question.java, and QuizGui.java and the dependencies that each class has on one another is explained with detail. It is for this reason that we believe that the screenful of text we would show another programmer to get them up to speed would be the README.md file. Giving them a source file would give little to no context to a programmer as to what the big picture is. After reading the README.md, we not only had a good idea of how the whole project was structured, but also how to begin to approach some of the issues.  

### (j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?

There are JUnit tests. The test coverage goes over all methods and each radix. An adjustment I would make is adding another test case for each radix seeing how there is only two tests for each at the moment. This way, more radix cases could be covered. As of now, there is no way to test the GUI. I am unsure if there are ways to test the GUI with JUnit tests. Another test that could be added is to test the correct and incorrect answers in the GUI. Besides those GUI cases, the test coverage is sufficient.
