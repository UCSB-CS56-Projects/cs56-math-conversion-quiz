Title: cs56-math-conversion-quiz
Brief Description: Math Conversion Quiz is a program that prompts users with questions regarding conversions between octal, binary, hexadecimal, and decimal. There is both a command line version and a GUI version.

User Stories:
As a student, I can use this math conversion quiz to practice my conversion skills in regards to octal, binary, hexadecimal and decimal so that I can gain a better understanding of computer science.

As a student, I can use this math conversion quiz to practice my conversion skills in an interactive GUI setting or a standard command line input output setting so that it can be more fun.

As a programmer, I can use this math conversion quiz I coded to showcase my programming skills and to help students practice their conversion skills.

As an instructor, I can use this math conversion quiz to assess the logic behind the code that my student has written so that I can gain a better understanding of his programming abilities.

Does Software Run Or Not?
Yes, the software runs. There are two modes: command line and GUI. The command line mode allows you to enter in the number of questions you want and it will proceed with prompting questions and determining if your input it correct or not. THe GUI mode allows you to choose between different modes: Binary, Hexadecimal, Octal, Decimal, Random, and Masking. It has a hint feature and performs the same functions as the command line.

User Stories for features that COULD be implemented:
As a student, I can use this math conversion quiz and its different modes including more than just binary/decimal/octa/hexadecimal conversion but also other categories of mathematical conversion so that I can be an expert when it comes to conversions.

As an instructor, I can use the math conversion quiz GUI interface and use the Hard and Easy options to fit the skill level accordingly with my students skill level.

As a student, I can use the GUI Opening Menu so that I can have a better experience utilizing this software to hone my conversion skills.

As a student, I can choose the number of questions I want in the GUI Mode so that I can customize it to my needs when I am practicing my conversion skills.

Assessment of the Current README.md:
For the most part, the README is very transparent in telling the reader what the program does and what it offers. There is even a screen shot on the GUI mode to show the reader how the software operates. There is also a section for Future Developers, in which they tell the reader how the files operate and some current issues. However, a blatant mistake is that Conversion is spelled Conversin on the document. In order for the next generation of people maintaining the code to have it easier, we could add a transparent structure on how to run the code (like a diagram or screenshots of a sample run).

Assessment of the Current build.xml:
The current build.xml file looks good. All the targets have descriptions (meaningful ones).

Assessment of the Current Issues:
Allie opened 6 issues. We want to create an Opening Menu for the GUI interface. After implementing that menu, we want to implement a Hard and Easy option and the option to choose the number of questions wanted. We also want to check the validity of the user input and fix a bug regarding the Masking Mode. Allie was pretty descriptive with all the changes she wanted to see so that was good. Point distribution seems to add up to around 1000 points so the current issues are good.

Actual Game

[BUG] Submitting the answer without entering any information will result in an incorrect answer [already documented in issues]

[POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] The art work can use some work.

[POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] Lots of blank space within the window. Very bland app. Could make it more colorful.

[POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] The hint button makes it too obvious (especially for Binary conversion (it shows you if you got the bit right (0,1)). Should make hints more meaningful.

Test Coverage: Looks fine to us.
