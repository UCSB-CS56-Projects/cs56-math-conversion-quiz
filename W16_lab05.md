Title: cs56-math-conversion-quiz
Brief Description: Math Conversion Quiz is a program that prompts users with questions regarding conversions between octal, binary, hexadecimal, and decimal. There is both a command line version and a GUI version.

User Stories:
As a student, I can use this math conversion quiz to practice my conversion skills in regards to octal, binary, hexadecimal and decimal so that I can gain a better understanding of computer science, and use this to study for tests.

As a student, I can use this math conversion quiz to practice my conversion skills in an interactive GUI setting or a standard command line input output setting so that it can be more fun.

As a programmer, I can use this math conversion quiz I coded to showcase my programming skills and to help students practice their conversion skills.

As an instructor, I can use this math conversion quiz to assess the logic behind the code that my student has written so that I can gain a better understanding of his programming abilities.

Does Software Run Or Not?
Yes, the software runs. There are two modes: command line and GUI. The command line mode allows you to enter in the number of questions you want and it will proceed with prompting questions and determining if your input it correct or not. The GUI mode allows you to choose between different modes: Binary, Hexadecimal, Octal, Decimal, Random, and Masking. It has a hint feature and performs the same functions as the command line.

User Stories for features that COULD be implemented:
As a student, I can use this math conversion quiz and its different modes including more than just binary/decimal/octa/hexadecimal conversion but also other categories of mathematical conversion (like two's complement) so that I can be an expert when it comes to conversions.

As an instructor, I can use the math conversion quiz GUI interface and use the Hard and Easy options to fit the skill level accordingly with my students skill level.

As a student, I can use the GUI Opening Menu so that I can have a better experience utilizing this software to hone my conversion skills.

As a student, I can choose the number of questions I want in the GUI Mode so that I can customize it to my needs when I am practicing my conversion skills.

As a programmer, I can add a feature to this conversion quiz game that provides an analysis of a users understanding of specific conversions by tracking which type of conversion problems the user got correct or incorrect and have the program display a page at the end of the quiz display the percentage of correct answers in each category and suggest which conversions the user should practice more.

As a programmer, I can make the instant feedback on the GUI version of the game also display what answer was entered right below the correct answer to help the user see where they might have gone wrong.

As a programmer, I can add an additional feature to the command line interface of the game that allows the user to select whether they want the entire question set to be all on one type of conversion, or have one of the intitial steps ask the user how many questions they want on specific conversion to enhance their experience and practice what they need to work on.

As a programmer, I can also include instructions on the page that explains how to input the answers ("no leading zeros", "no spaces", etc) to inform the user how to enter in the values so they don't get frustrated when the program says their input was incorrect but they actually got it correct.

Assessment of the Current README.md:
For the most part, the README is very transparent in telling the reader what the program does and what it offers. There is even a screen shot on the GUI mode to show the reader how the software operates. There is also a section for Future Developers, in which they tell the reader how the files operate and some current issues. However, a blatant mistake is that Conversion is spelled Conversin on the document. In order for the next generation of people maintaining the code to have it easier, we could add a transparent structure on how to run the code (like a diagram or screenshots of a sample run).

Assessment of the Current build.xml:
The current build.xml file looks good. All the targets have descriptions (meaningful ones).

Assessment of the Current Issues:
Allie opened 6 issues. We want to create an Opening Menu for the GUI interface. After implementing that menu, we want to implement a Hard and Easy option and the option to choose the number of questions wanted. We also want to check the validity of the user input and fix a bug regarding the Masking Mode. Allie was pretty descriptive with all the changes she wanted to see so that was good. Point distribution seems to add up to around 1000 points so the current issues are good.

Actual Game

[BUG] Submitting the answer without entering any information will result in an incorrect answer [already documented in issues]

[POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] The art work can use some work.

[POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] Lots of blank space within the window. Very bland app. Could make it more colorful.
https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-math-conversion-quiz/issues/30

[POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] The hint button makes it too obvious (especially for Binary conversion (it shows you if you got the bit right (0,1)). Should make hints more meaningful. 
https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-math-conversion-quiz/issues/31

[POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] The gui game could have a result page that displays the percentage of correct answers for each type of conversion and suggest that the lowest scoring section be the one the user should practice. Even have it create a button the user can click to go to a quiz on that particular conversion.

[POSSIBLE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT] Have the command line version ask the user how many questions they would like in each topic of conversions.

Test Coverage: Looks fine to us.
The test coverage is basically up to date. There are JUnit tests for all of the .java files with the exception of the ScoreLoader.java file. So nearly all of the code appears to be covered by tests with the exception of the score counter which works when you see it run. If we make the program track the types of conversion questions and track those, we might want to look into developing some tests to make sure that it is working properly.

Code structure
The organization of the code makes sense especially with the help of the READme file explaining how the naming conventions organizes what java files are performing certain tasks.
The purposes of each class as well as their methods are straightforward and clear. The classes all interact with each other for functionality of the program and the code is fairly easy to read and understand what is happening. There is some extended commented section in QuizGui.java but is left from where the previous people probably were trying implement the testing format part, but didn't get it to work successfully and is just left as a template with some guidance for the next people who come along. I would give the READme and a little bit of the Quiz.java file to someone being introduced to the project because the READme will let the new coder know where to look throughout the files and the Quiz.java will let provide a basic understanding of how the program is running since the gui also relies on this part.
